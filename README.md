# INSTAGRAM CLONE

As part of our Rails course, we've had to try and figure out how some popular apps were created using Rails. My first attempt was a blog-type app, and the second was a Twitter Clone (however, I wasn't able to figure out how to get the threaded replies and the followers-following system up) -- which you can find at https://github.com/arencrg/twitterclone

My third attempt at Rails is an Instagram clone. Again, I have the basic functionality down but I haven't been able to set up the design.
