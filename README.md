# INSTAGRAM CLONE

As part of our Rails course, we've had to try and figure out how some popular apps were created using Rails. My first attempt was a blog-type app, and the second was a Twitter Clone (however, I wasn't able to figure out how to get the threaded replies and the followers-following system up) -- which you can find at https://github.com/arencrg/twitterclone. My third attempt at Rails is an Instagram clone.

## Updates

25 Jul 2017 | I've been following Ben Walker's tutorial on creating an Instagram clone, but I've been adding my own little tweaks to it. After one day I've gotten the basic functionality down but I haven't been able to set up the design.

26 Jul 2017 | I've been switching between this project and the Twitter Clone, so I've kinda been half-assing both. I've yet to add how to display likes and followers-following. I also plan to add a "Log in with Facebook" function.


## To-do

- crop images into squares
- the design (CSS)
- following/followers
- Log in with Facebook (OmniAuth)
